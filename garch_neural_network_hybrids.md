# Literature Review: Hybrid GARCH Models with Neural Networks

## üß† Introduction

Traditional GARCH models are widely used for modeling volatility in financial time series due to their strong theoretical foundation and interpretability. However, their linear structure limits their ability to capture complex nonlinear patterns. Recent literature has explored the integration of **GARCH models with neural networks**, aiming to benefit from both the **statistical rigor of GARCH** and the **flexibility of machine learning models**.

This hybrid approach seeks to enhance **volatility forecasting**, improve the modeling of **tail risks**, and better accommodate **regime shifts** and **nonlinear dependencies** in financial markets.

## üî¨ Key Contributions

### 1. **Hybrid GARCH-ANN Models**
These models typically use a GARCH process to model volatility and an artificial neural network (ANN) to model nonlinear residual patterns or directly forecast volatility.

- **Xu et al. (2019)** ‚Äì Proposed an ANN-GARCH model where a feedforward neural network captures the nonlinear structure in financial returns, improving out-of-sample volatility forecasts.
- **Kim & Shin (2007)** ‚Äì Combined a GARCH model with a multilayer perceptron to capture asymmetry and leverage effects.

üìÑ Details in  : [Hybrid_GARCH_ANN.md](./Hybrid_GARCH_ANN.md)

### 2. **GARCH with Deep Learning Architectures**
Recent studies have applied more complex architectures such as **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks or **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**.

- **Zhang et al. (2020)** ‚Äì Introduced an LSTM-GARCH hybrid where GARCH models short-term volatility and LSTM captures long-term dependencies.
- **Qiu et al. (2021)** ‚Äì Used CNN-LSTM structures on top of GARCH filters to extract spatial-temporal features from multivariate financial time series.

üìÑ Details in  : [Zhang_LSTM_GARCH.md](./Zhang_LSTM_GARCH.md)

### 3. **GARCH Integrated into Network Architectures**
Some approaches embed the GARCH volatility equations directly into neural network layers, learning both the parametric and nonlinear structure end-to-end.

- **Wen et al. (2021)** ‚Äì Proposed a model where GARCH parameters are outputs of neural layers, enabling dynamic parameterization based on time-series features.
- **Chung et al. (2022)** ‚Äì Developed a GARCH-RNN hybrid where the RNN learns volatility dynamics with GARCH-inspired constraints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodologies and Training Approaches

- **Loss functions**: Mean squared error (MSE), negative log-likelihood, or asymmetric loss to emphasize tail events.
- **Optimization**: Backpropagation combined with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
- **Data**: Stock indices, FX rates, and cryptocurrencies are common benchmarks.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- **Volatility Forecast Accuracy**: RMSE, MAE of predicted volatility vs realized volatility.
- **Risk Metrics**: Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES).
- **Comparative Backtests**: Diebold-Mariano tests against classical GARCH and ML baselines.

## üìà Applications in Finance

- **High-frequency trading**: where fast volatility adaptation is critical.
- **Portfolio management**: for dynamic allocation strategies.
- **Derivative pricing and hedging**: particularly in volatile regimes.
