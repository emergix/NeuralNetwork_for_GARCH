# Application of GARCH Models in Asset Management

## 📈 1. Classic Applications of GARCH Models in Asset Management

### a. **Modeling Asset Volatility**
GARCH models are particularly suitable for modeling the conditional volatility of financial returns. They allow:
- short-term risk estimation,
- capturing the "volatility clustering" often observed in markets,
- forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR), widely used in risk management strategies.

### b. **Dynamic Asset Allocation**
Some funds use volatility forecasts from GARCH (or EGARCH, TGARCH, etc.) to dynamically adjust portfolio weights:
- reducing exposure during anticipated periods of high volatility,
- increasing exposure when predicted volatility is low (risk parity, volatility targeting).

## 🧠 2. Integration in Portfolio Optimization Models

Volatility and correlation forecasts from multivariate GARCH models (e.g., **DCC-GARCH**) are used to feed into portfolio optimization models, such as:
- **conditional variance minimization**,
- **dynamic mean-variance approaches**,
- or **active management models with constraints**.

## 🧪 3. Relevant Research

Key research contributions include:

- **Engle & Kroner (1995)** – on BEKK-GARCH models for multivariate volatility modeling.
  📄 Details in  : [engle_kroner_1995_en.md](./engle_kroner_1995_en.md)
  
- **Engle (2002)** – introduced the **DCC-GARCH** model, widely used for asset allocation.
- **Bauwens et al. (2006)** – a comprehensive review of multivariate GARCH models.
- Recent studies explore **GARCH models integrated with neural networks** (hybrid models) or **Bayesian hierarchical frameworks**.

## 🤖 4. Modern Extensions

Sophisticated asset managers now combine GARCH models with:
- **stochastic volatility models**,
- **regime-switching models** (e.g., Markov Switching GARCH),
- **machine learning techniques** to enhance volatility and return forecasts.
