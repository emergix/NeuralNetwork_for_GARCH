## 📈 1. Asset Volatility Modelling with GARCH Models in Asset Management

### a. **Modeling Asset Volatility**
GARCH models are particularly suitable for modeling the conditional volatility of financial returns. They allow:
- short-term risk estimation,
- capturing the "volatility clustering" often observed in markets,
- forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR), widely used in risk management strategies.

### b. **Dynamic Asset Allocation**
Some funds use volatility forecasts from GARCH (or EGARCH, TGARCH, etc.) to dynamically adjust portfolio weights:
- reducing exposure during anticipated periods of high volatility,
- increasing exposure when predicted volatility is low (risk parity, volatility targeting).

## 🧠 2. Integration in Portfolio Optimization Models

Volatility and correlation forecasts from multivariate GARCH models (e.g., **DCC-GARCH**) are used to feed into portfolio optimization models, such as:
- **conditional variance minimization**,
- **dynamic mean-variance approaches**,
- or **active management models with constraints**.

## 🧪 3. Relevant Research

## 🤖 4. Modern Extensions

Sophisticated asset managers now combine GARCH models with:
- **stochastic volatility models**,
- **regime-switching models** (e.g., Markov Switching GARCH),
- **machine learning techniques** to enhance volatility and return forecasts.
