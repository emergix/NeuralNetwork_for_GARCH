*Multivariate GARCH Models: A Survey*  
Published in _Journal of Applied Econometrics_, **21(1)**, 79‚Äì109.

## üß† Context

This paper by Bauwens, Laurent, and Rombouts (2006) provides a **comprehensive survey** of multivariate GARCH models up to the mid-2000s. It is widely considered a key reference for understanding the theoretical development, computational challenges, and empirical performance of various multivariate volatility models.

## üîç Goals of the Survey

- Categorize and compare different multivariate GARCH specifications,
- Evaluate their properties, advantages, and limitations,
- Discuss estimation strategies and practical challenges,
- Provide guidelines for empirical applications in finance and economics.

## üßÆ Major Model Families Reviewed

1. **VEC and Diagonal VEC Models**  
   - Full parameterization of the covariance matrix,
   - Often impractical due to parameter proliferation.

2. **BEKK Model (Engle & Kroner, 1995)**  
   - Guarantees positive definiteness,
   - More compact and feasible for implementation.

3. **Factor and Component Models**  
   - Reduce dimensionality by imposing structure,
   - Capture common sources of volatility across assets.

4. **Constant and Dynamic Conditional Correlation (CCC/DCC)**  
   - Parsimonious treatment of correlations (e.g. Engle, 2002),
   - Allow separation of variance and correlation dynamics.

5. **Copula-GARCH Models**  
   - Model marginal distributions with GARCH and use copulas for dependence,
   - More flexible in modeling tail dependence and asymmetries.

## üíº Applications in Finance

- **Risk management**: capturing co-movements in asset returns,
- **Asset allocation**: time-varying covariance for dynamic portfolios,
- **Hedging and derivatives pricing**: dependence structure crucial for joint behavior,
- **Stress testing and systemic risk analysis**.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- No single model fits all situations ‚Äî trade-off between flexibility and tractability,
- Model selection depends on the number of assets, data frequency, and purpose (forecasting vs. inference),
- Computational complexity remains a challenge for high-dimensional systems.
