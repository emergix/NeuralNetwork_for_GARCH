### 1. **Hybrid GARCH-ANN Models**

Financial markets are tricky to predict because they aren't always logical or follow simple, straight-line patterns. Prices can be calm for a while and then suddenly become very volatile. This sudden change in volatility, or risk, is a key challenge for financial experts.

The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is a powerful statistical tool designed to tackle this very problem. At its core, the GARCH model is great at capturing a well-known financial phenomenon called "volatility clustering," which means that big changes in price (either up or down) tend to be followed by more big changes, and small changes are followed by more small changes. Think of it like this: if the stock market has a really wild day, you can expect the next few days to be pretty bumpy too. GARCH does this by using past volatility to predict future volatility.

However, GARCH models have a limitation: they are primarily linear models, meaning they assume that the relationships between variables can be represented by a straight line. But financial markets often have nonlinear patterns, which are complex relationships that a simple straight line just can't capture.

#### Xu et al. (2019) - "Hybrid ANN-GARCH Model for Volatility Prediction"
**Core Innovation**: Combines traditional GARCH with a feedforward neural network to capture nonlinear patterns in financial returns.

This is where the Hybrid ANN-GARCH model comes in.


The Hybrid Approach: Combining Strengths

The core idea of the hybrid model proposed by Xu et al. (2019) is to combine the best of both worlds:

    Use the GARCH model to handle the well-understood linear, "volatility clustering" part of financial data.
    Here is a more detailed and readable explanation of the hybrid ANN-GARCH model, tailored for an average student.

The core idea of the hybrid model proposed by Xu et al. (2019) is to combine the best of both worlds:

    Use the GARCH model to handle the well-understood linear, "volatility clustering" part of financial data.

    Use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to find and model the more complex, hidden nonlinear patterns that the GARCH model misses.

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It's excellent at finding intricate, nonlinear relationships within data without needing to be explicitly told what those relationships are.

The goal is to have the ANN "clean up" the GARCH model's predictions by capturing the unpredictable, nonlinear leftover errors, or residuals, and adding that information back into the forecast.

Breaking Down the Model

1. The GARCH Component: The Foundation

The GARCH part of the model is responsible for calculating a measure of volatility, which is the conditional variance σt2​. Conditional variance just means the expected variance at a specific time, given all the information we have up until that point.

    The first equation, ϵt​=σt​zt​, shows that the prediction error at time t (ϵt​) is a random shock (zt​) multiplied by the current volatility (σt​). This is just a way of saying that on a volatile day, the error is likely to be larger.

    The second equation, σt2​=ω+αϵt−12​+βσt−12​, is the core of the GARCH model. It's a recursive equation, meaning it feeds its own past results back into itself to make a new prediction. It says that today's volatility (σt2​) depends on three things:

        A baseline level of volatility (ω).

        Yesterday's squared error (ϵt−12​), which tells us about how big yesterday's market shock was.

        Yesterday's volatility (σt−12​), which tells us how volatile things were in general.



    Use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to find and model the more complex, hidden nonlinear patterns that the GARCH model misses.

    The ANN's job is to find the nonlinear patterns in the GARCH model's leftover errors. Instead of just using the raw errors, the authors cleverly use standardized residuals as input for the ANN. A standardized residual is simply an error (ϵt​) divided by its predicted standard deviation (σt​), which helps to make the data more consistent and easier for the ANN to learn from.

    The input to the ANN, xt​, is a series of past standardized residuals. This is like giving the ANN a history of how wrong the GARCH model has been.

    The ANN then processes this information through a hidden layer using an activation function (ϕ). An activation function is a mathematical function that determines the output of a neuron, helping the network learn complex patterns. In this case, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function is used.

    Finally, the ANN produces an output, ϵ^t2​, which is its estimate of the nonlinear part of the squared error that the GARCH model missed. A linear activation function (ψ) is used in the output layer.

  The Hybrid Integration: Putting It All Together

This is where the two components are combined to create the final, more accurate prediction.

    The final hybrid volatility forecast, σt,hybrid2​, is calculated by taking the standard GARCH volatility and adding the ANN's special contribution.

    The term γϵ^t2​ is the ANN's part of the prediction, where γ is a parameter that controls how much weight is given to the ANN's findings. If the ANN is really good, γ will be large. If the ANN doesn't find much, it will be small.

    

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It's excellent at finding intricate, nonlinear relationships within data without needing to be explicitly told what those relationships are.

The goal is to have the ANN "clean up" the GARCH model's predictions by capturing the unpredictable, nonlinear leftover errors, or residuals, and adding that information back into the forecast.

The key takeaway is that by combining the strengths of a traditional statistical model (GARCH) and a powerful machine learning model (ANN), the researchers were able to create a new model that was significantly better at predicting financial volatility. By giving the ANN the specific task of finding nonlinear patterns in the GARCH residuals, they created a powerful forecasting tool. This hybrid model outperformed the standard GARCH model by a notable 15-22% in out-of-sample forecasts, which is a big deal in the world of financial prediction.

**Model Structure**:
1. **GARCH Component**:
   $$\epsilon_t = \sigma_t z_t, \quad z_t \sim N(0,1)$$
   $$\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta \sigma_{t-1}^2$$

2. **ANN Component** (nonlinear residual modeling):
   $$x_t = \left( \frac{\epsilon_{t-1}}{\sigma_{t-1}}, \frac{\epsilon_{t-2}}{\sigma_{t-2}}, \cdots, \frac{\epsilon_{t-m}}{\sigma_{t-m}} \right)$$
   $$h_k = \phi\left( \sum_{i=1}^m w_{ki}^{(1)} x_{t,i} + b_k^{(1)} \right) \quad \text{(hidden layer)}$$
   $$\hat{\epsilon}_t^2 = \psi\left( \sum_{k=1}^H w_k^{(2)} h_k + b^{(2)} \right)$$
   where $\phi$ = ReLU, $\psi$ = linear activation

3. **Hybrid Integration**:
   $$\sigma_{t,\text{hybrid}}^2 = \underbrace{\omega + \alpha \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta \sigma_{t-1}^2}_{\text{GARCH}} + \underbrace{\gamma \hat{\epsilon}_t^2}_{\text{ANN}}$$
   with $\gamma$ controlling ANN contribution

**Key Features**:
- Standardized residuals ($\epsilon_t/\sigma_t$) as ANN inputs
- Focuses on modeling residual nonlinear dependencies
- Outperformed standard GARCH by 15-22% in out-of-sample forecasts

---

$r_t = m(x_t; \vartheta) + \epsilon_t, \quad \epsilon_t = \sigma_t z_t, \quad z_t \sim D(0,1)$  

with $m(\cdot; \vartheta)$ an MLP and $\sigma_t^2$ following a GARCH-type recursion. Removing nonlinear mean structure can sharpen variance dynamics.

**(B) ANN as an additive or multiplicative correction to GARCH variance**  

Baseline GARCH($p,q$) variance:  
$h_t^{\text{GARCH}} \equiv \omega + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i \epsilon_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2, \quad \sigma_t^2 > 0$  

Add an ANN term $g(x_t; \vartheta)$:  

- **Additive (level):**  
  $\sigma_t^2 = h_t^{\text{GARCH}} + g(x_t; \vartheta), \quad g(x) \geq 0$  
  with positivity enforced via a link, e.g. $g(x) = \text{softplus}(y_t) = \log(1 + e^{y_t})$.  

- **Multiplicative (log-variance):**  
  $\log \sigma_t^2 = \log h_t^{\text{GARCH}} + y_t, \quad y_t = \text{MLP}(x_t)$  
  A numerically stable alternative is:  
  $\log \sigma_t^2 = h_t^{\text{lin}} + y_t$  
  with $h_t^{\text{lin}}$ a linear GARCH-style ARMA in $\log \sigma^2$.

**(C) ANN to capture asymmetry/leverage**  
Encode sign effects explicitly in inputs:  
$x_t = (\epsilon_{t-1}^2, \epsilon_{t-1} \cdot 1_{\{\epsilon_{t-1} < 0\}}, \sigma_{t-1}^2, |\epsilon_{t-1}|, \dots)$  

then map via $y_t = \text{MLP}(x_t)$ and set either:  
$\sigma_t^2 = h_t^{\text{GARCH}} + \text{softplus}(y_t) \quad \text{or} \quad \log \sigma_t^2 = \omega + y_t$  

This subsumes GJR/EGARCH-type asymmetries when the MLP is linear.

**(D) ANN-only volatility with GARCH-inspired inputs**  
$\sigma_t^2 = f(\epsilon_{t-1}^2, \dots, \sigma_{t-1}^2, \dots; \vartheta)$  
where $f$ is an MLP; classical GARCH is recovered by restricting $f$ to be linear and nonnegative.

### Design notes

- **Positivity**: Prefer log-variance parameterizations or positive links (softplus/exponential) on ANN outputs.  
- **Stationarity of the backbone**: Maintain $\sum_i \alpha_i + \sum_j \beta_j < 1$ for the GARCH component.  
- **Features**: Include realized volatility (RV), bipower variation, or option-implied measures when available; standardize inputs.  
- **Alternatives**: Replacing the MLP with an RNN/LSTM is straightforward, but most cited hybrids use MLPs for simplicity.






#### Kim & Shin (2007) - "MLP-GARCH Hybrid for Asymmetry and Leverage Effects"
**Core Innovation**: Integrated MLP with GARCH to capture asymmetric volatility responses (leverage effects).

**Model Architecture**:
1. **Asymmetric Input Encoding**:
   $$x_t = \left( \epsilon_{t-1}^2, \epsilon_{t-1}\cdot\mathbb{I}_{\epsilon_{t-1}<0}, \sigma_{t-1}^2, \cdots, \epsilon_{t-p}^2, \epsilon_{t-p}\cdot\mathbb{I}_{\epsilon_{t-p}<0}, \sigma_{t-q}^2 \right)$$

2. **MLP Structure**:
   $$y_t = W_2 \cdot \tanh(W_1 x_t + b_1) + b_2$$
   $$\Delta\sigma_t^2 = e^{y_t} \quad \text{(exponential link for positivity)}$$

3. **GARCH-MLP Integration**:
   $$\sigma_t^2 = \underbrace{\omega + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i \epsilon_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2}_{\text{GARCH core}} + \underbrace{\delta \Delta\sigma_t^2}_{\text{MLP asymmetry correction}}$$

**Key Findings**:
- MLP component successfully captured leverage effect where:
  $$\left. \frac{\partial \sigma_t^2}{\partial \epsilon_{t-1}} \right|_{\epsilon_{t-1}<0} > \left. \frac{\partial \sigma_t^2}{\partial \epsilon_{t-1}} \right|_{\epsilon_{t-1}>0}$$
- Reduced forecasting errors by 18-27% compared to EGARCH/GJR-GARCH
- MLP outperformed linear asymmetry terms in high-volatility regimes
