# 🧠 NeuralNetwork_for_GARCH

**Understanding GARCH Calibration with Neural Networks in Finance**

## 📌 Purpose of the Blog

This blog explores how neural networks can be used to calibrate the parameters of GARCH models, and how this approach can bring real value to practitioners in finance.

We aim to:
- Present the theoretical foundations behind GARCH models and their calibration.
- Illustrate how neural network methods outperform traditional optimization in speed and robustness.
- Show practical financial use cases in **asset management** and **exotic options trading**.

## 🏦 Use Cases in Investment Banking

### 💼 Asset Management
Neural network-based GARCH calibration can:
- Provide real-time volatility estimates for portfolio risk assessment,
- Improve Value-at-Risk (VaR) and CVaR calculations,
- Feed volatility forecasts into portfolio optimization algorithms.

### 📉 Exotic Options Trading
On the trading floor, this method is useful as:
- A **pre-calibration tool** for stochastic volatility models (e.g. Heston, SABR),
- A **quick snapshot of volatility clustering** under market stress,
- A way to bootstrap model parameters for pricing structured products.
