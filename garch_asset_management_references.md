## ðŸŸ¥ 1. Comparative Study of Multivariate GARCH Models for Portfolio Optimization

**Reference**: [ScienceDirect, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106294081830038X)

This study evaluates several multivariate GARCH modelsâ€”including DCC-GARCHâ€”for portfolio optimization using empirical financial data. The models are compared based on:
- Sharpe ratio,
- Value-at-Risk (VaR),
- Realized volatility.

**Conclusion**: Dynamic models like DCC-GARCH consistently outperform static covariance methods in risk-adjusted performance.

## ðŸŸ¥ 2. Flavin & Wickens (2000) â€“ Tactical Asset Allocation Using Multivariate GARCH

**Citation**: Flavin, T. J., & Wickens, M. R. (2000). _A multivariate GARCH model for predicting portfolio risk_. *Journal of Empirical Finance*.

Introduces a tactical allocation strategy based on GARCH-forecasted time-varying covariance matrices. Results show:
- ~5% reduction in realized portfolio risk,
- Improved rebalancing efficiency during regime shifts.

**Reference**: [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-014-0871-1)

This paper extends GARCH filtering to include higher-order moments (skewness, kurtosis). Key findings:
- Enhanced capture of asymmetric return behavior,
- Better performance than classical mean-variance frameworks.

**Reference**: [ssrn](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1355727)]

**Summary**: Proposes a Bayesian Copula-GARCH model with Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling to model dependence and parameter uncertainty. The framework allows:
- Joint estimation of tail risk and marginal volatilities,
- Robust performance under risk-averse scenarios.

**Outcome**: Reduced portfolio volatility and improved resilience to tail events.

Introduces an orthogonal GARCH model relaxing elliptical distribution assumptions. It is designed to:
- Capture non-Gaussian features of returns,
- Minimize rebalancing while preserving diversification.
